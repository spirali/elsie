# Elsie
**Elsie** allows you to **create slides programmatically** using Python.

*Elsie* is a Python library that lets you build
[SVG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) slides in a
composable way and then render them to PDF. There is no DSL or GUI â€“
presentations created with *Elsie* are fully programmed with Python.

## Hello world
```python
import elsie, datetime

slides = elsie.Slides()

@slides.slide()
def hello_world(slide):
    this_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
    slide.text(f"Hello from {this_year}!")

elsie.render("slides.pdf")
```
<img width="512px" height="384px" src="slide_imgs/hello.png">

## Features
- **Automatic layout** *Elsie* provides a simple yet powerful layout model. Need
  rows? Columns? Grids? Padding? Aligned text? Relative/absolute positioning?
  Automatic scaling? We got you covered.

- **Animations and fragments** Reveal your slides gradually using fragments or
  create custom step-by-step animations using Python code. Or draw a fine-tuned
  SVG image by hand in `Inkscape` and let *Elsie* turn it into an animation
  using a handy [layer-naming convention](TODO).

- **Source code highlighting** Enjoy automatic [source code highlighting](TODO).
  Create code walkthroughs using individual line highlighting or arrows pointing
  to specific code elements.

- **Batteries included** Leverage familiar SVG features - fonts, colors, dashed
  line borders, you name it. Include `PNG/JPG/SVG` images directly into your
  slides. Render [LaTex](TODO) into your slides. Debug your slides interactively
  in [Jupyter notebooks](TODO).

- **Familiarity** At its heart, *Elsie* is an API for creating SVG images,
  optimized for making slides. If you know basics of Python and SVG, you'll be
  right at home.

Every tool has its disadvantages though.

- *Elsie* provides a rather low-level API. While that means that you can create
  a slide in almost any way you like, you will sometimes have to roll up your sleeves
  to achieve your desired goal. But once you implement it, just put it inside a function
  and reuse it!
- *Elsie* produces PDF slides, so it can only create animations with a single
  frame per slide. If you need 60 FPS animations or GIFs in your presentations, this tool
  is not for you.
- Currently, *Elsie* renders SVG slides to PDF using `Inkscape`. Therefore, you
  must have it installed on your system for it to work. We provide a
  [Docker image](installation.md#docker-installation) with `Inkscape` for convenience.
- Elsie is tested only on Linux machines, if you find a problem on a
  different platform, do not hesitate to open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/spirali/elsie/issues/new).

## FAQ
- Why do you use `Inkscape` instead of e.g. `Cairo`?
TODO
- Why don't you use a known layout model, e.g. `flexbox`?

- Why is there no support for lists in `Elsie`?
